CHD TASK

First of all, thank you for trusting me and sending me a task to implement

Now, regarding the task assigned to me, I tried your API on Postman, but it did not work, and from my not a little experience in the backend, I feel that the API is not complete, but this did not stop me. I set up my own fake API that contains login, registration, and registration. Exit. I succeeded in making the front and back interface compatible with each other. I signed it in the Composition Api Script box with the token test, and after I finished with them, I put it inside a comment tag. Then I created a special Authuser for Nuxt and put it in the Setup Script box. I distinguished it by writing it in Typescript to highlight my javascript skills

As for the rest of the requirements, I validated the data in the inputs and protected it, and it works efficiently

I have put comments on the important codes for clarification

As for your question, what prevented me from communicating with you regarding the API part and solving the problem? Perhaps I am wrong. I saved time due to the short period of time assigned to me with my daily obligations. I was careful not to miss any time within the deadline set for me, and I apologize if I did not communicate with you regarding that problem. But I hope you understand my explanation of the above

In the end, thank you for this opportunity, and I hope you like the task. I am fully prepared to participate in an interview to explain the details of the code to test whether I was the one who wrote the code or not.
